### Brief introduction:
Captures user's voice and translates it to another language.

### Dependencies:
`pip install googletrans`

`pip install speechrecognition`

`pip install pyaudio`

... and that's it!


### Usage:
This is an easy code to capture a user's voice and translate it to particular language using Google's free API tools for language processing. Therefore, you will need internet connection to use `example_spanish.py`. Alternatively, you can use "CMU Sphinx" for offline usage to capture input but the translation still requires internet connection.
